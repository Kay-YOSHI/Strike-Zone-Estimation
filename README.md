# Strike-Zone-Estimation

This repository contains the R code for estimating the strike zone in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
I used the statcast pitch-by-pitch data on all regular season games in 2019, collected by using the R package "mlbr" (https://github.com/pontsuyu/mlbr). 
I estimated called strike probabilities and visualized it by contour plot.
