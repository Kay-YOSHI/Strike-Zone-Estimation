# Strike-Zone-Estimation

This repository contains the R code for estimating the strike zone in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
I used the statcast pitch-by-pitch data in 2019, collected by using the R package "mlbr". 
I estimated called strike probabilities and visualized the 50% contour as strike zone.
